# Odoo App Selection Guide

A structured knowledge base for mapping business scenarios to the correct Odoo apps.
Used by the AI migration tool to avoid importing data into the wrong models.

## The Decision Framework

Two questions cut through most app selection confusion:
1. **Whose asset?** Yours (internal) or the customer's?
2. **Where is the work done?** Your location, their location, or remote?

## Quick Reference: The "Fix Things" Matrix

The most common source of confusion. Use this 2x2:

| | **Your equipment** | **Customer's equipment** |
|---|---|---|
| **Your location** | **Maintenance** | **Repairs** |
| **Customer's location** | (rare) | **Field Service** |
| **Remote** | — | **Helpdesk** |

Helpdesk acts as the front door: a ticket can escalate to Repairs (ship it to us), Field Service (we come to you), or a refund/return.

## How to Use This Guide During Migration

Before importing data into any Odoo model:

1. Understand the client's business process (what do they do, for whom, where?)
2. Use the Decision Framework and Fix Things Matrix to identify the right app
3. Verify the required module is installed (`ir.module.module` via MCP)
4. Check the model's fields via MCP (`odoo://{model}/fields`) before mapping
5. If unsure — ask the client, don't guess

## Generating This Guide from Odoo

The app descriptions in this guide can be refreshed from any Odoo instance:

```python
# Via MCP: get all apps with descriptions
search_records(
    model="ir.module.module",
    domain=[["summary", "!=", ""], ["application", "=", true]],
    fields=["name", "shortdesc", "summary", "category_id", "state", "description"],
    order="shortdesc asc"
)
```

This gives you each app's official summary and description, plus whether it's installed.
